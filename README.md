# BPSK Perceptron ML Model 

in this general overview i just want to say, check those models i implemented and f you can share some ideas on how to improcw them, each have a read me file, and a main that implemets the whole code, you can change thinks inside the conf and if you want check out the data manipulation implemented.

## Overview

Im just a enthuast trying some thinks and see if I can improve anything related to wireless communication though AI or to be more specific some machine lerning code!!!

## future ideas

i will be starting with QAM i will try reusing the code of BPSK and see if i can addapt it to do QAM, the next step would me to use already ceated code and try for the best model, when i get that i will impment that moddel by hand and see how to improve on it, like making it depended on 2 or more information, why? i could detect if is one of manny QAM architecture and make a guess on letting the program identify for example if user 1 is 8QAM or if use 2 is 4QAM ... that would be more advance but possible still.
